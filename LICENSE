RootWyrm Public NONCOM Repository License    18012016

Copyright (c) 2016-* Phillip "RootWyrm" Jaenke. All rights reserved.

ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, MACHINE CODE, OR OTHER COPYRIGHTABLE
CONTENTS OF THIS REPOSITORY AND DERIVATIVE WORKS IS GOVERNED BY THIS LICENSE AND 
PERMITTED PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS ARE MET:

1. Redistributions of source code must retain the entirety of the above copyright notice
   intact, this list of conditions, and the disclaimer referenced below as "STDDISCLAIMER.H"
   This may be included as a separate file if technically necessary.
TRANSLATION: Your copyright notices need to include this one too. If you've got a valid
technical reason for putting it in 'LICENSE.rootwyrm' that's acceptable.
2. Redistributions in binary form and of derivative works must reproduce the above copyright
   notice in one of the below defined acceptable forms in "ACKNOWLEDGING", this list of 
   conditions, and the disclaimer referenced below as "STDDISCLAIMER.H"
TRANSLATION: You need to include this whole file. That's... really it.
3. Redistributions in source or binary form MAY NOT use or include the following names or
   terms outside of the required inclusion or in an approved form as defined in "ACKNOWLEDGING"
   without express written permission of the original author identified above:
   * The author's name or any variation thereof
   * RootWyrm or any variation thereof
   * "RootCore", "RootLXC"
   * "BabyDragon", "LittleDragon", "VirtualDragon", "DragonSuite"
TRANSLATION: Hey, great, you like my code. You wanna give me a shoutout, that's fantastic.
But seriously, don't go using my name or copyrighted names in your project or product. If you
really want to call it "RootWyrm is Awesome", get permission first.

4. Derivative works in source or binary form MAY NOT use or include any of the names or terms
   listed in clause 3 above, or imply any endorsement or approval in any fashion unless explicit
   written permission has been obtained from the above copyright holder.
TRANSLATION: You absolutely have permission to use the code however you want (as long as it
complies with the license) and I'm glad you like it. But unless you got my permission up front,
don't go claiming you're the official anything. I'm not allowed to say I'm the Queen of England,
you're not allowed to say you're RootWyrm's Chosen One. Fair? Fair.

5. Use of this software WITHIN COMMERCIALLY LICENSED PRODUCTS is expressly prohibited without 
   the written permission of the original author. Use "WITHIN" is defined as the inclusion of
   the whole or any part of the licensed source code, executables, or executables produced by 
   the software or documentation covered by this license.
   "WITHIN" specifically EXCLUDES commercial products which MAKE USE OF the licensed software
   but DO NOT INCLUDE any licensed code. As an example, a compiler licensed under these terms
   may not be included in a commercial product - but binaries generated by the compiler may
   be distributed commercially as non-derivative works.
TRANSLATION: Build your products WITH my stuff - not AROUND and ON my stuff. If you're getting
paid for it or charging money for it? THAT'S COMMERCIAL. If you're using whizbang.sh to clean 
up before shipping, then hey, you're in the clear. If you're including a copy of whizbang.sh as
a utility script? The hammer will be dropped. Note that if you're getting paid to deploy, use, 
or fix it, that's charging for your time - not the code - and therefore not commercially licensed.
   
6. Use or inclusion of this software WITHIN OPEN SOURCE LICENSED PRODUCTS is expressly 
   prohibited where ANY alteration of license terms is required for inclusion. The above license
   is and remains the ONLY valid license, and contents may only be sublicensed with the express
   written permission of the author.
TRANSLATION: You can totally include this in your open source bundle, your distribution, your crazy
virtual appliance (so long as you're not charging and provide source code.) But you absolutely may 
not change the license of this code for ANY reason. I don't CARE what the pipe-smoking hippie tells
you is okay. I don't go traipsing around demanding you change YOUR stupid licenses, so don't you dare 
come here demanding I change mine!

HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT

OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF

IN SHORT, IF YOU USE THIS AND IT CAUSES A NUCLEAR MELTDOWN, YOUR WIFE TO LEAVE 
YOU, YOUR DOG TO RUN AWAY, AND ALSO HAVING TO WATCH PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE 
WITHOUT RIFFTRAX? WE'RE NOT LIABLE. YOU WERE WARNED. AND NOW YOU CAN'T SUE US.

"ACKNOWLEDGING"
The rules are very simple and don't require a lot of shouting. In a nutshell, we require
you to acknowledge that your work builds on ours. (Don't worry, we'll reciprocate!) The simplest form:
"MyProduct includes software developed by Phillip 'RootWyrm' Jaenke and others." - done. Was that so hard?
Say you want to be fancier: "MyProduct wouldn't be possible without thanking Phillip 'RootWyrm' Jaenke for 
BabyDragon, used here with permission." You get the idea. So long as you aren't implying an endorsement 
or papal blessing from us, we're cool with it.

LAST LINE CLAUSE:
If you are an attorney admitted to practice law in any country in the world, upon reading this line, you are required to
exchange a glass of beer or wine with the author at the earliest mutual convenience. Caution, RootWyrm brings Ohio micros. :)
